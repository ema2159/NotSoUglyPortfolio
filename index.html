        <h2>Hello</h2>
        <p class="profile-description">
          Hello there! My name is Emmanuel. I'm an Electrical Engineer
          specialized in computers and networks. Although I know how to do
          circuits and stuff, my passion is coding and software engineering. I
          have knowledge in many programming languages and I find it easy to
          learn new languages and technologies. Also, due to my engineering
          background, I have a lot of problem solving skills.
        </p>
        <p class="profile-description">
          I am also a musician and I love exercising. I am a very curious person
          and I enjoy being challenged!

          <p class="dark-text">
            I have plenty of experience programming in Python. I've used it for
            scripting, data science and machine learning and it is my language
            of choice.

          <p class="dark-text">
            Apparently, I'm a web developer now, so I can do web developer stuff
            like programming inefficiently and such. I now know HTML, CSS and
            soon I'll now Javascript.

            As proudly mentioned in this page's title, I'm an engineer, which
            implies I have plenty of skills in a wide variely of areas such as
            mathematics, physics, statistics but more importanly, I know how to
            find clever solutions to difficult problems.
